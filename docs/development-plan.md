# REPRAM Development Plan

This document outlines the phased development approach for REPRAM, a distributed ephemeral key-value storage network.

## Phase 1: MVP Core (Foundation) ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Single-node proof of concept with basic functionality

### Completed Components:
- ✅ **Core Storage Engine**: In-memory key-value store with TTL-based expiration
- ✅ **Client SDK**: Basic encryption/decryption, key generation, and network communication
- ✅ **Simple API**: REST endpoints for PUT/GET operations with TTL support
- ✅ **Encryption Layer**: Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption with key derivation
- ✅ **Basic Node Daemon**: Accept writes, store encrypted blobs, handle TTL cleanup
- ✅ **Technology Decision**: Go chosen for implementation
- ✅ **Dual Architecture**: Separation of open-source node and proprietary SDK

### Key Deliverables:
- Working single-node system with encrypted ephemeral storage
- Client SDK with transparent encryption/decryption
- Open-source node that can store unencrypted data
- Proprietary SDK that provides encryption capabilities
- Comprehensive build and demo system

## Phase 2: Distributed Network (P2P Foundation) ✅ COMPLETED

**Goal**: Multi-node gossip network with data replication

### Completed Components:
- ✅ **Gossip Protocol**: Peer-to-peer message propagation for data replication
- ✅ **Bootstrap Discovery**: Static node list with dynamic peer discovery  
- ✅ **Quorum Confirmation**: Ensure writes are replicated across multiple nodes
- ✅ **Network Transport**: gRPC-based transport layer implementation
- ✅ **Health Monitoring**: Node health checks and ping-based failure detection
- ✅ **Symmetric Architecture**: All nodes equal, no coordinator/leader election

### Key Deliverables:
- Multi-node cluster with configurable replication factor
- gRPC-based gossip protocol for peer communication
- Quorum-based write confirmation (majority consensus)
- Bootstrap node discovery with dynamic peer management
- Health monitoring with periodic ping/pong heartbeats
- Integration test scripts for cluster validation

## Phase 3: Production Ready (Hardening)

**Goal**: Deployment-ready system with operational features

### Planned Components:
- **Container Packaging**: Docker images optimized for Flux/Kubernetes
- **Advanced Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, logging, alerting
- **Security Hardening**: Authentication, rate limiting, DDoS protection
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory management, connection pooling
- **Persistence Options**: Optional FluxDrive/disk snapshots for resilience
- **Load Testing**: Stress testing and performance validation
- **Documentation**: API docs, deployment guides, operational runbooks

### Production Features:
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Observability and monitoring integration
- Security and access control
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Deployment automation
- Operational procedures and troubleshooting

## Phase 4: Extensions (Future Features)

**Goal**: Advanced features and ecosystem integration

### Planned Components:
- **Long-term Storage**: Paid persistence layer for extended TTL
- **IPFS Integration**: Large blob offloading to IPFS network
- **Reputation System**: Node reliability scoring and selection
- **Web3 Bridges**: Integration with blockchain authentication
- **Advanced Encryption**: Post-quantum cryptography support
- **Cross-network TTL**: Compliance features for data governance

### Advanced Features:
- Integration with decentralized storage networks
- Blockchain-based authentication and authorization
- Advanced cryptographic protocols
- Compliance and regulatory features
- Extended persistence options
- Network reputation and trust mechanisms

## Development Principles

### Architecture Guidelines:
- **Zero Trust**: Nodes cannot decrypt or interpret user data
- **Interface-based Design**: Pluggable components for extensibility
- **Client-side Encryption**: All cryptographic operations happen in SDK
- **Symmetric Network**: No central coordinators or leaders
- **Ephemeral by Design**: TTL-based automatic data expiration

### Dual Licensing Strategy:
- **Open Source Node**: Core storage and networking functionality
- **Proprietary SDK**: Encryption, key management, and client libraries
- **Network Growth**: Open-source nodes enable community deployment
- **IP Protection**: Encryption and advanced features remain proprietary

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 (✅ Completed):
- Single node storing and retrieving encrypted data
- Working client SDK with encryption
- Open-source node capability demonstration
- Clean separation of proprietary and open-source components

### Phase 2:
- Multi-node cluster with data replication
- Automatic peer discovery and failure handling
- Gossip-based data propagation
- Quorum-based write confirmation

### Phase 3:
- Production deployment on Flux/Kubernetes
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Performance benchmarks and optimization
- Security audit and hardening

### Phase 4:
- Integration with external storage networks
- Advanced cryptographic features
- Ecosystem partnerships and integrations
- Compliance and regulatory features

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the immediate priorities are:

1. **Begin Phase 2**: Start implementing gossip protocol for peer-to-peer replication
2. **Peer Discovery**: Design bootstrap mechanism for node discovery
3. **Network Protocol**: Choose and implement transport layer (gRPC vs custom)
4. **Testing Framework**: Build integration tests for multi-node scenarios
5. **Documentation**: Create detailed API specifications and protocol documentation

The foundation is solid, and the architecture supports the planned distributed features while maintaining the clean separation between open-source and proprietary components.
