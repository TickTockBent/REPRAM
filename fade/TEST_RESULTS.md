# REPRAM Fade Multi-Node Test Results

## ✅ Successfully Implemented Features

### 1. **Cool Key Generation**
The client now generates memorable keys like:
- `msg-quantum-phoenix-1748557236937000000900`
- `msg-cyber-nexus-1748557236937000000123`
- `msg-indolent-baboon-1748557236937000000456`

Much better than the old `raw-1748557236937` format!

### 2. **Node Tracking & Display**
- Each message shows which node served it: `[node-1]`, `[node-2]`, `[node-3]`
- The server adds custom headers:
  - `X-REPRAM-Node: node-1`
  - `X-REPRAM-Node-URL: http://localhost:8080`
- Messages display the node indicator in purple next to the key

### 3. **Connection Status Indicator**
Above the message board, you'll see:
- **INITIALIZING...** - When first loading
- **SCANNING NETWORK...** (with spinning icon) - Every 3 seconds during polling
- **CONNECTED [node-X]** - Shows which node was last used
- **CONNECTION ERROR** (with blinking red) - If network issues

The indicator includes a cool scanning line animation at the bottom.

### 4. **Improved Network Status Display**
The network status now shows:
- **All 3 nodes** with their individual health status
- **Active node count** updates correctly
- **Current node indicator** shows which node is preferred by the load balancer

## How to See It All in Action

1. **Open Fade UI**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Send a Message**: You'll see the new key format
3. **Watch the Connection Indicator**: See it change to "SCANNING" every 3 seconds
4. **Check Message Metadata**: Each message shows `[node-X]` to indicate storage location
5. **Open Developer Console**: See detailed node status logs

## Technical Implementation

### Server Changes (`server.go`)
- Added `/api/nodes/status` endpoint for node health checking
- Added `X-REPRAM-Node` headers to all proxied responses
- Node status tracking with health checks

### Client Changes (`client.js`)
- Cool key generation with adjective-noun-timestamp format
- Node tracking for all messages
- Connection status indicator with animations
- Improved network status display

### Style Changes (`styles.css`)
- Connection status styling with animations
- Node indicator badges
- Scanning line animation effect

## Load Balancing Behavior

When you send multiple messages rapidly, you'll see them distributed across nodes:
- Message 1 → `[node-1]`
- Message 2 → `[node-2]`
- Message 3 → `[node-3]`
- Message 4 → `[node-1]` (cycles back)

This demonstrates the round-robin load balancing in action.

## Visual Improvements

The UI now provides much better feedback about:
- Which node is handling your requests
- Network scanning activity
- Connection health
- Individual node status

The hackerpunk aesthetic is maintained with:
- Animated status indicators
- Scanning line effects
- Color-coded node badges
- Retro terminal feel

Perfect for demonstrating REPRAM's distributed nature!
