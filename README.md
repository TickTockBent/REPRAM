# REPRAM

**REplicated EPhemeral RAM** - A distributed, ephemeral key-value storage network designed for high-performance, privacy-preserving applications. It provides a permissionless interface for encrypted, self-expiring data storage with zero trust assumptions.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Encrypted Storage**: Client-side encryption ensures zero knowledge by the network
- **Ephemeral Data**: Time-to-live (TTL) enforced automatic data expiration
- **Distributed Architecture**: Symmetric node architecture with no central coordinator
- **Zero Trust**: Nodes cannot read or interpret user data
- **Production Ready**: Docker, Kubernetes, monitoring, and security hardening
- **Dual Licensing**: Open-source node software with proprietary encryption SDK

## üèó Architecture

REPRAM consists of two main components:

### Open Source Node
- Stores arbitrary binary data with TTL expiration
- REST API for data storage and retrieval
- In-memory storage with automatic cleanup
- Can be deployed by anyone to join the network
- Production hardening with rate limiting and security

### Proprietary SDK
- Client-side AES-256-GCM encryption
- Key generation and management
- Transparent encryption/decryption
- Available under commercial license
